        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
          I’m currently employed as an <strong>Application Support Analyst</strong>, with a strong interest in
          <strong> DevOps, Cloud Engineering</strong> and <strong>Software Development</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy solving production issues, improving reliability, and working with teams to keep systems stable.
          I’m also comfortable working with <strong>SQL</strong> and building solutions that improve operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, I’m focused on growing in cloud and DevOps practices — automation, CI/CD, and building
          scalable systems.
